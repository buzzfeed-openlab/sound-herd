# sound-herd
a collection of small birds that locate each other by sound and sync individual color data over the internet

The sound herd is an experiment with time, sound, and color. Each "bird" locates its flock by singing one note in an arpeggio. A bird that hears all its brethren will send out its color data to share it with the flock. If the birds can't locate one of their flock, they sing the note of the missing bird repeatedly until they hear it again.

The sound herd uses a Particle Photon and several libraries edited for this system-- the [Adafruit Neopixel library](https://github.com/technobly/SparkCore-NeoPixel) edited by technobly, the [Adafruit TCS34725 library](https://github.com/krvarma/Adafruit_TCS34725_SparkCore) adapted by krvarma, and part of an [audio library](https://github.com/enjrolas/L3D-Software/tree/master/Native/Audio) used in the L3D Cube by enjrolas.
